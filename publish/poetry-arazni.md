# Dear Arazni (2024)

I wrote this one about my favorite [Pathfinder goddess, Arazni](https://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=326).

```text
The tip of your rapier
will be as sharp tomorrow

The edge of memory
  forged by centuries' resolve
    from the raw ore of indignities
will still blazon his name

The tip of his thorax
  just as supple tomorrow
    just as pleasant to puncture
will stretch eternal
  perforated
  pinned to the pile
    of corpses who crossed you
    
But tonight
  my dear dear god
may you unclench your jaw
  rest your wrist
  dip in the spring
and sleep
```
