# Arazni's Blog

Hey y'all.

Setting up a blog. One chapter is for TTRPG thoughts, play experiences, and stories. One is for poetry. We'll see how it goes!

You can find my [Pathfinder 2e Analysis blog here](https://arazni.github.io/pathfinder-analysis).

You can find my [Blades in the Sheets web app](https://arazni.github.io/blades-in-the-sheets) for Blades in the Dark and Scum and Villainy (with screen-reader testing) here.

If you'd like to encourage my work, consider buying me a coffee. ðŸ’–
