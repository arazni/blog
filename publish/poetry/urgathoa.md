# You Taught Me the Longing of Cannibalism (2024)

I wrote this one about an ex, vaguely mapped onto the idea of her being a worshipper of [Urgathoa, a Pathfinder goddess](https://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=295) of undeath and gluttony.

The offering of self
  hands smashing through rib after rib
  drool slurring into my veins
  jaws sinking in my ever beating heart
for long awaited annihilation
  fleshed into permission and purpose
  to end me and sate you

I want to see you ravenous
  ravishing in the rubied necklace of my blood
like when you pressed my head down
  eager to quiver under my tongue

I would give you my tongue
  pierce it to a gold keychain
  embalm it in luscious preservatives
  motorize it with batteries
    as mine slow to a stop
  train it with neural networks
    to perfect the pleasures
      that evoke your song

Make of me your sacrament
  chase my blood with my warm smile
  and thorn my crown with your nails

Make of me tua nonna
  limping through the kitchen
  lungs gruff and gagging
    but still she provides
    and still she shouts
  mangi! mangi! mangi!

Bury me inside you
  leave mother earth starved
    maw agape and coffinless

Take the nutrition I promised to bugs
  and spend it on whimsy

You cannot waste me as long as you still breathe
```
