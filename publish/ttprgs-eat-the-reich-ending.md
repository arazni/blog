# Endings: Killing the Final Boss in One Shot in Eat the Reich (2024)

A massive werewolf amalgam of occult research and biological experimentation carrying multiple swords on his back, each sharper than the last.

Chuck, American cowboy vampire, gives the ol' hauk-tuah to launch a glob of acid spit (+) on the floor to weaken the metallic supports (++), then grabs the massive boss and shoves him through the hole. He scurries like a spider (+) through the hole and shoots (+++) the last (++) two bullets of his paired revolvers, Betsy and Maria, in a standoff duel (+) while hanging from the low ceiling (+).

Significantly injured and lashing out in desperation, the boss slashes up at Chuck with vicious force. But Chuck leans into it, allowing his legs to be severed off of his body in order for his corrosive blood to shower all over the boss.

This corrosion tears through the boss's flesh and the floor, leaving his corpse melting in a mess of boiling blood.

Silence for a moment. The vampires above approach the newly made hole to peer inside, only to see Chuck claw his way out of the hole.

In a haunting rhythm, choking up blood, missing everything below his torso, one elbow forward at a time, approaching a frightened Hitler cowering in the corner, puddled by his own piss, he starts his slow chant.

"U. S. A. U. S. A. U. S. A."
